# udpsigner
â€‹

This is a simple framework to run MPC tests.
It uses UDP discovery to find other nodes, based on the project:
https://github.com/schollz/peerdiscovery 

It also uses 
https://github.com/manifoldco/promptui 
to provide a simplistic stateful CLI

Everything is underconstruction atm, but it should work.

As of beginnig of March 2021, there is only a couple of MPC algorithms: to calculate a BLS public key and a BLS message signature based on the (threshold) key shares owned by the nodes.
One can import the key shares generated by a simple CLI tool form:
https://github.com/san-lab/secretsplitcli

Getting the code: 

    git clone https://github.com/san-lab/secretsplitcli
    git clone https://github.com/san-lab/udpsigner.git
